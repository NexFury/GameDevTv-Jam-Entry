  storyText: 'Clothes, clothes. clothes. The number of clothes piled up in the wardrobe
    leaves you in awe. Also at the bottom of the rack you spot some files. Left slightly
    open, you can''t make much of it but judging from what is visible it seems as
    if it''s a document about money. Perhaps loans or something.... These clothes
    and makeup sets seem to cost a lot...

    Mirror
