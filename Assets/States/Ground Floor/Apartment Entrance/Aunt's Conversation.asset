  storyText: 'The two aunts are gossiping among the happenings in the neighbourhood.
    "There''s apparently a discount on Eggs at the XYZ store", "Lately a cat has

    come out of the room for the last  days" and stuff like that.... Idle banter.
    After listening into their chats, you decide to head back to the corridor.
