  storyText: 'You enter the second room from the left. Inside you see a student sitting
    at his desk, tapping his feet, and a book on a desk. It seems like he''s reading
    or studying. There probably won''t be much to see here, as you didn''t have much
    interactions with him. But you feel wary if there''s something, so you can decide
    to inspect anyway.


    What will you do?

    1. Inspect Desk

    2. Inspect
    Window

    3. Inspect Kitchen

    4. Head back to corridor'
