  storyText: 'It was 5 days ago, You decided to pick up a game, and got hooked on
    it. You were playing it day and night, unaware of the time. Sleepless nights
    went by, you managed to reach the second last level of the game... Suddenly,
    you started feeling dizzy, a slight headache came by and you crashed onto the
    ground, leaving yourself into the current state as it is now....

    died due to lack of sleep, over a game you never managed to clear and is the
    reason you ended up as a haunted spirit....
