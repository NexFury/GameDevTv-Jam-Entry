  storyText: 'You get confused, yet you have full composure of yourself. Perhaps
    the state of your current self has led you detached from all emotions. You figure
    out that whatever time you have left, it might be best if you search around for
    some clues as to figure out how you died.


    What will you do?

    1. Look
    around the room.

    2. Head outside for some clues.

    3. Inspect the body.'
